I maintain this space more than anything to have a place to collect my thougths. 
At the same time, I love the idea behing open-source coding, and 
the html/jekyll code for this website is therefore free to download 
[at my github site](https://github.com/kpolsen). 

See [contact](https://kpolsen.github.io/contact/) if you have questions for me!
