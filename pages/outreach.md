## Organizer of Python meetings
At Arizona State University (ASU) I organized group meetings for scientists using python in their research at ASU. 
Meetings are every second week and we have a github repository to share knowledge and ask questions. 
We decided a topic for each meeting based on where people are having most struggles! 
I passed the organization of these meetings onto Joe Chen at the Physics Department of ASU, 
so if you would like to join the mailing list or be part of the github repository, 
please send him an email. 
Typically, the meetings start with a short presentation by someone who has experience in 
the topic followed by discussion and hands-on learning. 
The group includes undergrads to professors, and is not restricted to members of the 
School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE). 
so if you would like to join the mailing list or be part of the github repository, 
just shoot Joe (or me) an email.

### Co-organizer of P^3 = Postdoc Posters and Pie Research Forum at SESE in 2016 and 2017, ASU

I helped organizing annual poster conferences at SESE, ASU, for postdocs and others to see 
some of the amazing science that goes on at SESE! Below are a couple of photos taken at the scene:
