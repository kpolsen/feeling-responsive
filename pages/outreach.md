## Organizer of TIP meetings: Tips in Programming
At the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) I organize group meetings on various topics dealing with tools and techniques used, 
mainly in data analysis, but also in software development and data management. 
Each session is about an hour long with a format very much alike that of the Python meetings I was arranging at ASU (see below). 
But the crowd consists of mainly electrical engineers, with a different set of challenges, and we have a lot of fun sharing new methods. 

<br>

## Organizer of Python meetings
At Arizona State University (ASU) I organized group meetings for scientists using python in their research at ASU. 
Meetings are every second week and we have a github repository to share knowledge and ask questions. 
We decided a topic for each meeting based on where people are having most struggles! 
I passed the organization of these meetings onto Joe Chen at the Physics Department of ASU, 
so if you would like to join the mailing list or be part of the github repository, 
please send him an email. 
Typically, the meetings start with a short presentation by someone who has experience in 
the topic followed by discussion and hands-on learning. 
The group includes undergrads to professors, and is not restricted to members of the 
School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE). 
so if you would like to join the mailing list or be part of the github repository, 
just shoot Joe (or me) an email.

### Co-organizer of P^3 = Postdoc Posters and Pie Research Forum at SESE in 2016 and 2017, ASU

I helped organizing annual poster conferences at SESE, ASU, for postdocs and others to see 
some of the amazing science that goes on at SESE! Below are a couple of photos taken at the scene:

<b style="color: #006699">02-18-19: Meeting at Bornholms Energi & Forsyning (BEOF)</b><br>
As a way of disseminating my first results in the research area of renewable energy, I traveled to the island of Bornholm and gave a talk 
at the transmission (and distribution) system operator BEOF in Rønne, Bornholm. 
We use a very valuable data set taken on Bornholm since 2017, and it therefore made much sense to present the results on the island. The paper presented, 
is currently under review for a PowerTech conference.<br>
Title: 'Analysing Power Consumption and Generation on Bornholm: Best Energy Storage Options for High Shares of Renewables'.

<b style="color: #006699">09-20-18 to 09-21-18: CITIES 5th General Consortium Meeting, Fredericia, Denmark</b><br>
I participated in <a href="http://smart-cities-centre.org/events/consortium-meetings/"><font color="#660033">the annual consortium meeting</font></a> 
of the CITIES (Centre for IT-Intelligent Energy Systems in cities) project. 
This project aims at improving the integration of different energy sectors, such as gas, power, district heating/cooling and biomass. 
Equally important is to forecast, control and optimize the interactions of these different energy sectors through the use of advanced ICT solutions.
