## Co-chair of Tucson Women in Astronomy (TWA)
As of April 2020 I am co-chairing the <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/tucson-women-astronomy"><font color="#660033">TWA group at Steward Observatory</font></a>. 
This is a group consisting presently of mainly women, but open to any gender minorities in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). 
We use the group to socialize, network and discuss challenges and opportunities that may arise when working in STEM as a gender minority.

## Organizer of TIP meetings: Tips in Programming (2018-2019)
At the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) I organized group meetings on various topics dealing with tools and techniques used, 
mainly in data analysis, but also in software development and data management. 
Each session was about an hour long with a format very much alike that of the Python meetings I was arranging at ASU (see below). 
But the crowd consisted of mainly electrical engineers, with a different set of challenges compared to those of astronomers, and we have a lot of fun sharing new methods.

## Book an expert: Visiting 8th graders to talk about STEM (2019)

On April 4 2019 I attended a 1-day workshop organized by <a href="https://ekspert.engineerthefuture.dk/"><font color="#660033">Engineer the Future</font></a>, aimed at increasing the interest for STEM among students in Danish primary and high schools. I learned different ways to activate an audience (of all ages) and how to build a catching storyline for a presentation. Following the course, I visited two primary schools in Denmark (Mølleholmskolen and Boesagerskolen) to talk to their 8th graders about renewable energy. For a couple of hours, I would take over the classroom and start an interactive discussion on the use of Hydrogen as an energy storage in tomorrow's power and transport sector.

I organized a workshop at Arizona State University, centered on the challenge of modeling line emission in galaxies near and far. This workshop brought together experts as well as students in the field for 3 days of talks and focused discussion sessions.<br>

## Organizer of Python meetings (2015-2018)
At Arizona State University (ASU) I organized group meetings for scientists using python in their research at ASU. 
Meetings are every second week and we have a github repository to share knowledge and ask questions. 
We decided a topic for each meeting based on where people are having most struggles! 
I passed the organization of these meetings onto Joe Chen at the Physics Department of ASU, 
so if you would like to join the mailing list or be part of the github repository, 
please send him an email. 
Typically, the meetings start with a short presentation by someone who has experience in 
the topic followed by discussion and hands-on learning. 
The group includes undergrads to professors, and is not restricted to members of the 
School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE). 
so if you would like to join the mailing list or be part of the github repository, 
just shoot Joe (or me) an email.

### Co-organizer of P^3 = Postdoc Posters and Pie Research Forum at SESE in 2016 and 2017, ASU

I helped organizing annual poster conferences at SESE, ASU, for postdocs and others to see 
some of the amazing science that goes on at SESE! Below are a couple of photos taken at the scene:
