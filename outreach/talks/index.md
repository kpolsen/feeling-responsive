<b style="color: #006699">07/01/2021: Invited talk at EAS 2021</b><br>
I will be giving a talk at the <a href="https://eas.unige.ch/EAS2021/"><font color="#660033">Annual Meeting for the European Astronomical Society </font></a> virtual conference. Rather than my research in astronomy, my talk will form part of the session called "Astronomy for planet Earth: forging a sustainable future", and I will talk about my experience transitioning into green energy research as an astrophysicist. My talk is titled "From stars to Earth: Working on renewable energy research as an astrophysicist".

<br>

<b style="color: #006699">02/18/2019: Meeting at Bornholms Energi & Forsyning (BEOF)</b><br>
As a way of disseminating my first results in the research area of renewable energy, I traveled to the island of Bornholm and gave a talk 
at the transmission (and distribution) system operator BEOF in Rønne, Bornholm. 
We use a very valuable data set taken on Bornholm since 2017, and it therefore made much sense to present the results on the island. The paper presented, 
is currently under review for a PowerTech conference.<br>
Title: 'Analysing Power Consumption and Generation on Bornholm: Best Energy Storage Options for High Shares of Renewables'.
