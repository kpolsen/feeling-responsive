## 2019
<br>

<b style="color: #006699">08-12-16: ICAE2019, Västerås, Sweden</b><br>
At the <a href="http://www.applied-energy.org/icae2019/"><font color="#660033">International Conference on Applied Energy</font></a>, I presented a conference paper that I submitted back in May and which was accepted together with roughly 800 others.

<b style="color: #006699">06-09-19: DAWN Summit, Copenhagen, Denmark</b><br>
I was invited to join the yearly summit at the <a href="https://dawn.nbi.ku.dk/"><font color="#660033">Cosmic Dawn Center</font></a>, where I gave a 15 min talk on ongoing an future SIGAME projects.

<b style="color: #006699">06-17-19 to 06-21-19: Zoom-In and Out: From the Interstellar Medium to the Large Scale Structure of the Universe</b><br>
I was invited to join the 4-week <a href="https://agenda.albanova.se/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=6551"><font color="#660033">NORDITA workshop</font></a> devoted to the theoretical and observational studies of the interstellar medium of galaxies across cosmic time. I attended the 3rd week, and gave a 40 min presentation with the title "Reading between the lines - The benefits of modeling more than one emission line". <a href="{{ site.url }}/pages/presentations/NORDITA_June_19.pdf"><font color="#660033">View and download a PDF version of the talk here</font></a>.

<b style="color: #006699">02-18-19: Meeting at Bornholms Energi & Forsyning (BEOF)</b><br>
As a way of disseminating my first results in the research area of renewable energy, I traveled to the island of Bornholm and gave a talk 
at the transmission (and distribution) system operator BEOF in Rønne, Bornholm. 
We use a very valuable data set taken on Bornholm since 2017, and it therefore made much sense to present the results on the island. The paper presented, 
is currently under review for a PowerTech conference.<br>
Title: 'Analysing Power Consumption and Generation on Bornholm: Best Energy Storage Options for High Shares of Renewables'.

## 2018
<br>

<b style="color: #006699">09-20-18 to 09-21-18: CITIES 5th General Consortium Meeting, Fredericia, Denmark</b><br>
I participated in <a href="http://smart-cities-centre.org/events/consortium-meetings/"><font color="#660033">the annual consortium meeting</font></a> 
of the CITIES (Centre for IT-Intelligent Energy Systems in cities) project. 
This project aims at improving the integration of different energy sectors, such as gas, power, district heating/cooling and biomass. 
Equally important is to forecast, control and optimize the interactions of these different energy sectors through the use of advanced ICT solutions.

<br>

<b style="color: #006699">04-20-18: SESE Cosmology seminar</b><br>
I gave a talk at my department, summarizing my recent work with <a href="https://kpolsen.github.io/SIGAME_dev/"><font color="#660033">SÍGAME</font></a> and outlining on-going and future 
research projects. Title: 'Making Sense of FIR Line Emission with Synthetic Observations'.
