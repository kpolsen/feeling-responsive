This is a weekly, virtual talk series held in an informal format and centered on the topic of galaxy evolution theory.

The main purpose is to give students and postdocs in our group here at University of Arizona exposure to other institutes now that conferences are cancelled or going online due to the pandemic. But we also have a wide audience from other institutions calling in. 

I started the sessions in March when lock-down forced everyone to work from home and it's been building momentum since then, as a place where we feel less isolated and can share our research results. 

Talks are anything from 15 to 30 min long and can contain either published work or work in progress that needs comments or both!

Below is a list of previous and scheduled talks, with links to zoom recordings (the links stay active for 200 days after the day of recording!). To get on the mailing list or become a speaker, email me at karenolsen (at) arizona.edu.
