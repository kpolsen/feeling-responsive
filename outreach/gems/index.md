Since Spring 2020, I have been leading GEMS group at Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona. 

GEMS works to raise awareness around and promote gender equality in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). We welcome people of all genders who are interested in improving gender equality in the field of Astronomy, and particularly encourage those who identify as gender minorities (e.g., female, transgender, or non-binary) to join us.
 
During each semester, our community comes together in a safe space to discuss any challenges and opportunities that arise from being a gender minority in STEM. To get on the mailing list, email me at karenolsen (at) arizona.edu.

Below is a list of people that the group has hosted meetings with. Most of the people listed were also colloquium speakers visiting Steward Observatory at the time.
