### Easy pancakes for two (or one if very hungry)
1.5 cups flour (can be mixed types)<br>

1 egg (vegan: 3 tbsp linseed to 1 dl water)<br>
3 tbsp butter<br>
- Mix all the dry ingredients well<br>
- Heat butter and mix with the other wet ingredients<br>
- Make a hole in the flour and add the wet stuff<br>
