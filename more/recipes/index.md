## My own

### Easy pancakes for two (or one if very hungry)
1.5 cups flour (can be mixed types)<br>
1 big tsp baking powder<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
2 tsp sugar<br>
1 tsp vanilla powder<br>
1 1/4 cups milk<br>
1 egg (vegan: 3 tbsp linseed to 1 dl water)<br>
3 tbsp butter<br>
- Mix all the dry ingredients well<br>
- Heat butter and mix with the other wet ingredients<br>
- Make a hole in the flour and add the wet stuff<br>
- *Dont't* mix too well since that can make the pancakes "heavy"<br>
- Fry! In butter, coconut oil, sesame oil or whatever!<br>


### Easy overnight bread
Ready the evening after!!<br>
12 dl water<br>
300g rolled oats and whole grain flour<br>
about 400g regular flour<br>
20g yeast<br>
1 tsp sugar<br>
2 tsp salt<br>
- Mix and add flour until reaching a porridge, sticky consistency.
- Let it rise overnight in fridge<br>
- Oil a baking pan with olive oil, place the dough and cover with more oil<br>
- let rise at room temp another 6 hrs or so<br>
- Half an hour at 225 Celcius <br>
- Then down to 150 Celcius until done (30min?)<br>

### Pizza dough
25g yeast<br>
800g pizza flour<br>
200g wholegrain flour<br>
600 ml water<br>
2 tsp salt<br>
a bit of sugar and olive oil<br>
- dilute salt in water, add sugar, yeast and oil<br>
- 15 min kneading<br>
- leave in fridge (or 10 Celcius) overnight<br>
- the day after, stretch the dough (don't smash) in trays with oil and turn over so covered in oil<br>
