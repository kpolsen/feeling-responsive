It is not unusual to see people with umbrellas on a sunny day in Arizona. 
After living there a few months, I too built up the habit of always bringing 
an umbrella with me if I had to walk far. 
The sun is powerful in the Southwest, and a source of energy that one can rely on. 
So much so that the California Energy Commission has decided that [all new houses 
mush have solar panels installed][1]. 
At Arizona State University where I worked, solar panels are everywhere and 
the university came in 1st in a 2015 search for [the US campuses producing most solar power][2] 
([nearly 50 percent of ASU's current daytime peak load][3]).

### So what's the problem?

The sun is strong when people are working. When everyone goes home (say at 4pm if you're lucky) 
the sun is already low on the horizon and the solar energy production is much reduced from it's 
peak at midday. 
Typically this is shown with an average *load curve* (or *load profile*) which is the instantaneous 
demand as a function of time over a specified time interval. 
Averaging over a number of days, the load profile for a day might look like the blue curve in the figure below, 
whereas the profile of solar power generated could be the green curve:
