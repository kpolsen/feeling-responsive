### On an evening walk 
Now that the nights are getting brigther on the Northern Hemisphere, evenings when the wind has dropped are a good time to go for a walk in nature. 
I never paid much attention to the small flowers that cover the Danish landscape in Spring (other than "oh isn't that pretty"). 
But I soon realized that many of my neighbors here in Munksøgård know Danish flora as I know how to use a computer. 
Needless to say, I became jelly and curious to know what I've been missing!

That's how I got invited on a date with my neighbor Lisbet, who is a professional gardner. 
After a common dinner (where I had been cooking a Thai green curry dish), we went out in the Sun again together with a couple other garden and bird enthusiasts. 
In the gallery below, I tried to name all the flowers I still remember!
