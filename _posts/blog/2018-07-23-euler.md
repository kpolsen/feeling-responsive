Back when studying for my bachelor in physics, I remember faintly connecting wires to voltmeters 
and making sure that an experiment could run without overheating the wires. 
But that's a long time ago. 
So as I'm getting into the field of renewable energy, I started reading 
[this wonderful book on Electric Power Systems - a conceptual introduction][1] 
(as recommended by a colleague at work). 
When my dad saw that I was reading up on the complex notation 
used in electrical engineering, he asked me whether I had ever seen the 
derivation that allows for these complex numbers. 
When I replied no, he got all giddy looking for a piece of paper to write down Euler's formula[^2].

### What does Euler's formula say?
If *j* is the [imaginary unit][3] and *x* a real number, the exponential function says:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e^{jx} =  \cos x + j \sin(x)" border="0"/>

(in electrical engineering the imaginary unit is typically called *j* to not confuse it with current, *i*)

### Ohm's law for impedance

An electric circuit really always consists of just tree types of elements in addition to a power supply: 
resistors, capacitors and inductors. 
In (super) short, resistors dissipate electrical power as heat whereas capacitors and 
inductors store that energy. 
Furthermore, capacitors resist changes in voltage, while inductors resist changes in current. 

If a circuit contains only a resistor of resistance *R*, we can use Ohm's law to calculate the voltage 
drop **V** across each resistor given the current *I*:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V = RI" border="0"/>

A similar formula can be created for the *impedance* which contains not only the resistance but also 
the *reactance* from capacitors and/or inductors. 
The trick to do so is to switch to complex numbers!

### Complex description of AC circuits
In AC circuits, the voltage alternates as a function of time 
and can be roughly represented as a cosine (or sine) wave function of 
frequency omega. 
Typically, the current will have the same frequency but perhaps offset by a 
phase shift phi. 
Thus, we can write the time-dependent voltages (v(t)) and currents (i(t)) as:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v(t)=V\cdot \cos (\omega t)" border="0"/> (1)<br>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i(t)=I\cdot \cos (\omega t + \phi)" border="0"/> (2)

where V and I are the real amplitudes. 
Imagine that we defined a complex voltage, 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{\mathbb{V}}" border="0"/><br>
such that the real part of 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{\mathbb{V}}" border="0"/> 
would give the same cosine function:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Re(\overline{\mathbb{v}(t)}(t))=V\cdot \cos (\omega t)" border="0"/><br> 

And likewise for 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{\mathbb{i}}(t)" border="0"/>:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Re(\overline{\mathbb{i}}(t))=I\cdot \cos (\omega t + \phi)" border="0"/>

That way we have defined the following two complex amplitudes:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{\mathbb{V}}=Ue^{j0}" border="0"/> <br>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{\mathbb{I}}=Ie^{j\phi}" border="0"/>.


### The case for inductors
The fact that inductors resist changes in current, can be written in differential form as:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v(t)=L\cdot \frac{di(t)}{dt}" border="0"/> 

where L is the inductance measured in *henry*. Using eqs. 1 and 2 above, this can be written as:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V\cdot \cos(\omega t) = L\cdot \frac{dI\cdot \cos(\omega t +\phi)}{dt}" border="0"/><br>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Rightarrow V\cdot \cos(\omega t) = -\omega L\cdot \sin(\omega t +\phi)" border="0"/> (3)

By now using Eulers formula, we write both sides of the equation as real parts of a complex number:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Re(e^{j\omega t}) =  Re(\cos (\omega t) + j \sin (\omega t)) = \cos (\omega t)" border="0"/>

and likewise,

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Re(j\cdot e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}) =  Re(j\cdot\cos (\omega t + \phi) + j\cdot j \sin (\omega t + \phi)) = -\sin (\omega t+\phi)" border="0"/>

since <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?j\cdot j = -1" border="0"/>.

Now comes the fun part! We can choose to write eq. 3 with complex numbers:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V \cdot Re(e^{j\omega t}) =  \omega L \cdot Re(j\cdot e^{j(\omega t + \phi)})" border="0"/><br>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Rightarrow V\cdot e^{j\omega t} =  j\omega LI e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}" border="0"/><br>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Rightarrow V =  j\omega LI e^{j\phi}" border="0"/>

Where we can recognize and replace by the complex voltages and currents:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{\mathbb{v}}(t)=j\omega L\cdot\overline{\mathbb{i}}(t)" border="0"/> 


This is now an exact analogue of Ohm's law where 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?j\omega L" border="0"/> 
plays the role of *complex impedance*, Z.
