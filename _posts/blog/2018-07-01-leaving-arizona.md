Arizona feels like home to me and always will. Being there for three years, 
I became friends with the most wonderful people. 
From the people I met at work to those I met in an airport, from 
the the people I lived with to the ones I did aerial acrobatics with.

How to say goodbye to them all? 

Well, I didn't.

Instead, I had a "Hasta La Vista" party with the certainty that I will always 
return one way or another. 
The party was held in a beautiful and very original Adobe house in Laveen, 
a rural outskirt of Phoenix, 
where my friend Michael and his wife Shannon 
lives with a few horses and two dogs. 
We had a fire, did aerial acrobatics out in the open and 
I organized a raffle for one of my Bob Ross paintings :)

I also went to visit a friend who was currently living outside Kingman, 
in a going off-the-grid community. 
These last days before my return to Denmark, turned into 
a truly magic time for me that I will always cherish! 

Below are some photos to give you an idea.

## How to embed a gallery

You just need to choose a template like the [`page`][3]- or [`page-fullwidth`][4]-template and then just use `{% raw %}{% include gallery %}{% endraw %}`.

`{% raw %}{% include gallery %}{% endraw %}` lets you easily embed a gallery into your post. To use the gallery-include...


### Step 1

1. Make two images: a thumbnail and a big image.
2. Name the thumbnail *gallery-image-thumb.jpg* and...
3. ...name the big *gallery-image.jpg*.
4. Place them in the *images*-folder.


### Step 2

Define the big version in frontmatter,  

~~~
gallery:
    - image_url: gallery-image.jpg
~~~

If you like captions, give each image a caption:

~~~
gallery:
    - image_url: gallery-image.jpg
       caption: Starting Page with huge One Logo
~~~

### Step 3

Add the include whereever you want in your content with `{% raw %}{% include gallery %}{% endraw %}`.

{% include alert info='Have a look at this example-entry. And have a look into the images-folder. :)' %}
