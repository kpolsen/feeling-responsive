### Taking the electric ferry from Denmark to Sweden
Getting to Kullaberg from Copenhagen was extremely easy. We rented a car in the morning, drove up to Helsingør and took the *electric* ferry (https://www.forsea.dk/) to Helinsborg. The ferry only takes 15 min and goes every 20 min!


### The hike
After parking in Mölle and receiving a map and some suggestions in the sweet Mölle Krukmakeri & Café, we hiked north towards Kullen lighthouse. There we had lunch and checked out the visitor's center [Naturum Kullaberg](http://www.kullabergsnatur.se/En/Pages/naturum-kullaberg.aspx). 
Then we started hiking West towards Arild, desperately trying to find signs for an art installation on the beach called [Nimis](https://www.guidebook-sweden.com/en/guidebook/destination/nimis-sculptures-near-arild-at-kullaberg), but ended up running out of time, so we cut turned off the hiking path and went back to Mölle for a rest at the Krukmakeri, where Mexican DJ El Diablo was reminding us of Cinco de Mayo.
