In between work, aerials and going to Tucson, I've found small pockets 
of time to paint with acrylics again.

I also finally bought a Bob Ross master oil paint set! Time to get started with 
one of his famous [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQd0). 
Excited to try out oil paints.

A couple of weeks ago I managed to convince Luis and Rachel to try out an 
intro class to aerial on a Sunday morning! So proud 
of how much work they put into it:
