Dates: 2017-11-12 to 2017-11-24

One of my favorite painters was a Danish communist. 
[Hans Scherfig](https://www.b.dk/kunst/jungledroemme) (1905-79) was an important writer in Denmark, 
but also an avid painter of jungle themes. 
I've been working on a Scherfig-inspired jungle theme for my friend who is having a baby soon:

I also finally bought a Bob Ross master oil paint set! Time to get started with 
one of his famous [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQd0). 
Excited to try out oil paints.

A couple of weeks ago I managed to convince Luis and Rachel to try out an 
intro class to aerial on a Sunday morning! So proud 
of how much work they put into it:
