Back when studying for my bachelor in physics, I remember faintly connecting wires to voltmeters 
and making sure that an experiment could run without overheating the wires. 
But that's a long time ago. 
So as I'm getting into the field of renewable energy, I started reading 
[this wonderful book on Electric Power Systems - a conceptual introduction][1] 
(as recommended by a colleague at work). 
When my dad saw that I was reading up on the complex notation 
used in electrical engineering, he asked me whether I had ever seen the 
derivation that allows for these complex numbers. 
When I replied no, he got all giddy looking for a piece of paper to write down Euler's formula[^2].

### What does Euler's formula say?
If *j* is the [imaginary unit][3] and *x* a real number, the exponential function satisfies:

(in electrical engineering the imaginary unit is typically called *j* to not confuse it with current, *i*)

### Ohm's law for impedance

An electric circuit really always consists of just tree types of elements in addition to a power supply: 
resistors, capacitors and inductors. 
In (super) short, resistors dissipate electrical power as heat whereas capacitors and 
inductors store that energy. 
Furthermore, capacitors resist changes in voltage, while inductors resist changes in current. 

If a circuit contains only a resistor of resistance *R*, we can use Ohm's law to calculate the voltage 
drop **V** across each resistor given the current *I*:

A similar formula can be created for the *impedance* which contains not only the resistance but also 
the *reactance* from capacitors and/or inductors. 
The trick to do so is to switch to complex numbers!

### Complex describtion of AC circuits
In AC circuits, the voltage alternates as a function of time 
and can be roughly represented as a cosine (or sine) wave function of 
frequency omega. 
Typically, the current will have the same frequency but perhaps offset by a 
phase shift phi. 
Thus, we can write the time-dependent voltages (v(t)) and currents (i(t)) as:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v(t)=V*\cos (\omega t)" border="0"/>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i(t)=I*\cos (\omega t + \phi)" border="0"/>
