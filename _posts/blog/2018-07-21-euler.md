Back when studying for my bachelor in physics, I remember faintly connecting wires to voltmeters 
and making sure that an experiment could run without overheating the wires. 
But that's a long time ago. 
So as I'm getting into the field of renewable energy, I started reading 
[this wonderful book on Electric Power Systems - a conceptual introduction][1] 
(as recommended by a colleague at work). 
When my dad saw that I was reading up on the complex notation 
used in electrical engineering, he asked me whether I had ever seen the 
derivation that allows for these complex numbers. 
When I replied no, he got all giddy looking for a piece of paper to write down Euler's formula.

### What does Euler's formula say?
If **i** is the [imaginary unit][3] and **x** a real number, $blabla$ the following is true:

$$ e^{ix} =  cos x + i sin x $$
