My trade is research, and my work more often than not takes place in the gap betweeen observations and theory. 
In that gap, we have model predictions to tell us what to expect, while observations have the power to 
support or discard a theoretical model. 

My formal education includes a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Copenhagen, but I have since expanded into 
areas of research dealing with renewable energy.

At the time of writing, I have been working for little more than a year on energy system operation and management as a 
postdoc scientist at the Technical University of Denmark. 
Before that, I did my first postdoc in astronomy at Arizona State University 
in Phoenix right at the heart of the beautiful Sonoran desert.

However, this Fall I plan to return to the far-away galaxies, picking up a grant from NASA and working from 
Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona in Tucson. 

This strange career path means that my research projects are split into two topics:
