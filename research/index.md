My trade is research, and my work often takes place in the gap betweeen observations and theory. 
In that gap, we can make models that produce predictions, while observations have the power to 
support or discard those theoretical models. 

Although I believe we are never too old to learn, my formal education ended with a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Copenhagen, and since then I have had two postdocs, one in astronomy and one in renewable energy research.

At the time of writing, I am PI and work on a NASA-funded project to study the interstellar medium of nearby galaxies using far-infrared line emission. I carry out my research at Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, in Tucson, right at the heart of the beautiful Sonoran desert.

Before that, I worked for a year and a half on energy system operation and management as a postdoc scientist at the Technical University of Denmark. Prior to that, I did my first postdoc in astronomy at Arizona State University in Phoenix.

This strange career path means that my research projects are split into two topics:
