My trade is research, and my work more than often takes place in the gap betweeen observations and theory. 
In that gap model predictions tell us what to expect, while observations have the power to 
support or discard a theoretical model. 

At the time of writing, I have recently finished a 3-yr postdoc in astronomy at Arizona State University 
in Phoenix right at the heart of the beautiful Sonoran desert. 
However, I'm off to try out a postdoc in renewable energy for a year, so my research projects are split in two topics:
