My most recent work in astronomy I carried out as a post-doctoral researcher at the [School of Earth and Space Exploration](https://sese.asu.edu/) (SESE)
at Arizona State University (ASU). 
There I carried out independent research on galaxies far away from our own Milky Way. 
My mentors were [Sangeeta Malhotra](https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/sangeeta-malhotra) and [Rogier Windhorst](http://sese-archive.asu.edu/people/rogier-windhorst).

My main research project at ASU has been SÍGAME - a module designed to model nebular line emission in the 
far-infrared from galaxies and make predictions for future observations. 
Here's an example of a flux map in [CII] fine structure line at 158 micron of a model galaxy:

I started developing SÍGAME during my PhD at the Dark Cosmology Centre, a Center of Excellence in Denmark. 
Over the years, it grew into a mature software tool, rewritten in python and applicable to many cases of 
galaxy studies. 
I have led three first-author publications on SÍGAME and enjoyed working with team members from around the world, 
and the software tool is now available for download via GitHub.

<h2 style="color: #006699">Organizing a conference on simulations of line emission</h2>

In March 2018 I organized and lead a 3-day workshop calleld 'Walking the Line' on simulating line emission from galaxies. 
It attracted around 30 researches of all ages from around the world with three prominent invited speakers. 
The program included several break-out sessions and group discussions at the end of each day. 
At the end of the workshop it was decided to write up a proceedings paper on the conclusions 
and scientific questions for the future resulting from our discussions. 
Writing this paper was one of the best experiences in my career within astrophysics so far, because 
I think we were able to highlight the most important challenges faced by astronomers in this field; 
[Read the open source conference paper here](http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4434/6/4/100/htm). 
I was also lucky to be surrounded by motivated and encouraging participants of the workshop, most of which 
helped in the writing of the paper.

<h2 style="color: #006699">X-ray imaging of galaxies</h2>

At the Dark Cosmology Centre, I also worked on a more observational project which quantified the presence 
of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in massive galaxies at redshifts around 2 (about 10 billion years ago!) 
using [CHANDRA]() archival X-ray data. 
High luminosity AGN are easily detected in X-ray at these redshifts, but to count the low luminosity AGN, 
it is necessary to apply some sort of stacking technique:

![Stacking of X-ray images of AGN](agn.png)

As an additional criteria when selecting AGN, the spectral shape of the X-ray emission can be used. 
For quantifying the slope of the X-ray spectra, astronomers typically use the observed "hardness ratio" between 
soft and hard X-ray flux. In the following figure from our paper, X-ray luminosity (on the y-axis) and 
hardness ratio (on the x-axis) are used to identify luminous AGN (filled symbols) and 
potential low-luminosity AGN (open symbols). Stacks of non-detections are shown with squares 
and blue and red colors signify star-forming and "quenched" galaxies, respectively:

![Classification scheme to identify AGN](agn1.png)

We find in the paper that the low-luminosity AGN population constitutes a significant part of both the 
star-forming and the "quenched" galaxies at redshifts around 2. 
See my 2013 paper below for more details on the technique and results.

Keywords: <i>Evolution of galaxies; Epoch of re-ionization; Interstellar Medium, 
Emission lines in radio; Radio interferometry; Galaxy simulations</i> <br>

My research focuses on the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of galaxies, i.e. that gas out of which stars are formed. 
The amount and properties of the ISM play a crucial role for the evolution of a galaxy, yet for galaxies at 
high redshifts both are poorly determined by observations. 
By observing a portion of ISM in different wavelengths, different images emerge, 
and astronomers can extract important information from each:<br><br>

![The interstellar medium (ISM)](ism.jpg)

The best technique for observing the ISM is to look for emission lines in the infrared (left bottom panel above), 
where rotational lines of molecules and fine structure lines of atoms and ions are easily excited at 
typical ISM temperatures and densities. <br><br>
