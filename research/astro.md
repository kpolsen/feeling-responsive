My most recent work in astronomy I carried out as a post-doctoral researcher at the [School of Earth and Space Exploration](https://sese.asu.edu/) (SESE)
at Arizona State University (ASU). 
There I carried out independent research on galaxies far away from our own Milky Way. 
My mentors were [Sangeeta Malhotra](https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/sangeeta-malhotra) and [Rogier Windhorst](http://sese-archive.asu.edu/people/rogier-windhorst). 
See the [Contact](http://kpolsen.github.io/Contact/) tab for my contact info in case you have any questions.
